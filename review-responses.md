### Summary Of Contributions:

This paper presents a method for graph node classification that can manually select the resolution at which the graph should be simplified.

### Strengths And Weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

1. Graph coarsening is important and practical.
2. The experimental results in Figure 1 seem promising.

**Weaknesses:**

1. The presentation of this paper has large room for improvement. The presentation in its current form makes the reader can not get the main idea easily.
2. The motivation is not clear. Why the author study this problem and why it is important.

### Suggested Changes:

Please address my concerns in the **Weakness** part.

### Rating:

Clear, Correct, and Reproducible (CCR): a submission which meets the reviewing criteria
### Confidence:

3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct

### Summary Of Contributions:

The paper proposes a novel way of studying relationship between graph coarsening levels and model performance on downstream tasks.

### Strengths And Weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

1. The paper is conscise and clear and can be well understood by readers.
2. The authors propose a method based out of HARP to evaluate the relationship between model performance and graph coarsening levels.

**Weakness:**

1. The utility of this evaluation is not yet clear to me as to obtain graph embeddings a t a level k s.t 0<k<l we still need embeddings of level k+1 till l, hence in no way we are reducing the levels of coarsening that w want to achieve.
2. The paper proposes that by learning on a specific downstream task, it is possible to achieve same performance by reduction of node count by 40%, does that mean that if coarsen a graph by 40% ad then use embedding generated by HARP and predict, we will get same performance as the original graph? This is not yet clear to me

### Suggested Changes:

1. I Would like to get more clarity on utility of this framework and how it will be used.

### Rating:

Great Start (GS): a submission which meets some of the reviewing criteria but has room for improvement

### Confidence:

3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct

### Summary Of Contributions:

This paper addresses the performance/complexity trade-off in the graph node classification task. The authors claim to show that their method provides near-optimal performance at a fraction of the complexity.

### Strengths And Weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

1. The premise of the problem and the description are presented clearly.
2. Figure 2 showing the results consists of a lot of information and they are illustrated in an easy to understand manner.

**Weaknesses:**

1. The abstract could be more descriptive.
2. It is unclear how coarsening and prolongation are exactly decoupled. I apologize if I missed it.

### Suggested Changes:

1. It may be beneficial to provide a quick one sentence definition of coarsening somewhere in the introduction
2. Why do some networks perform significantly poorly compared to others? Any insight into this?

### Rating:

Clear, Correct, and Reproducible (CCR): a submission which meets the reviewing criteria

### Confidence:

3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct
