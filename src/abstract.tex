\begin{abstract}
	We present a method for graph node classification that allows a user to precisely select the resolution at which the graph in question should be simplified. The method is based on refining a reduced graph in a targeted way following the node classification confidence for particular nodes. Hence, the method provides a meta-model for enhancing graph embedding models such as node2vec.
